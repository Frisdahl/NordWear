Thank you for that clear feedback. "They all succeed on Stripe and I get no messages in my console" means your server's webhook handler is not being hit at all.

This strongly suggests the issue lies in how your `stripe listen` command is set up or if it's correctly forwarding events.

Please provide the following information:

1.  **The exact command you are running for `stripe listen`.** (e.g., `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5000/api/stripe/webhook`)
2.  **The full output you see in the terminal when you first start `stripe listen`** (before you attempt any payments). This initial output confirms if it's running and what URL it's forwarding to.
3.  **Confirm that your server is indeed running on `http://localhost:5000`** in a separate terminal window when you attempt the payment.

With this information, we can pinpoint whether the `stripe listen` command is the problem, or if there's something else preventing the events from being forwarded to your local server.
